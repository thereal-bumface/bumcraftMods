Mods for BumCraft Server

Add "https://github.com/thereal-bumface/bumcraftMods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" to the Import from Zip (Local file or link to a direct download) in the MultiMC Launcher. This will allow you to sync your mods with the BumCraft server. If you ever are unable to connect, simply add a new instance, remove the old one, and use the same link.
